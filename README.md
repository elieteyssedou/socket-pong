# Socket Pong

![Socket Pong Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

This project was, for me, an introduction to Elixir and Phoenix. I wanted to try Phoenix Channels, the high performance of Elixir and the concurrent aspect of Erlang. What's better than an online Pong game to give it a shot ?

To start Socket Pong:
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * Then, visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
